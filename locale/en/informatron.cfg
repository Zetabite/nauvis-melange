text_welcome=Welcome to the Nauvis Melange mod. To get started on producing [img=item/spice] __ITEM__spice__, research [img=technology/spice-processing] __ITEM__spice__ processing.

text_spice-processing=To get hold of the [img=item/spice] __ITEM__spice__ you need to find a __ENTITY__worm-hole__, which you can create by killing a worm or placing a __ITEM__sandtrout__, or find one by sheer luck.\nAfter this you need to place a [img=item/water-injector-proxy] __ENTITY__water-injector__ on it and fill the hole with water. Once its full the __ENTITY__water-injector__ will explode, leaving the __ITEM__pre-spice-mass__ behind. This you can then simply mine.

text_alien-breeding=Breeding aliens is rather easy. Once researched, you can craft an [img=item/alien-probe] __ITEM__alien-probe__, which you then use near an alien to get a sample of their blood. This blood is then used in the __ENTITY__alien-growth-chamber__ to grow an alien leech.
