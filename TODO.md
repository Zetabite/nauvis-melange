# Actual TODO
- vehicles
    - mobile spice harvester -> D.U.N.E.
        - not as expensive as water injector setup
        - less effective than water injector setup
    - travel worm
        - add to force table and rebuild every game launch
        - thumper - calls travel worm
            - a capsule where the capsule_action has uses_stack set to false
            - thumper calls the nearest worm of force
            - procedure
                1. call
                2. copy render data
                3. make invisible
                4. spawn in folding animation
                5. teleport
                6. spawn out folding animation
                7. save render data back to entity
        - subgroup for different travel worms
    - spawn worms when travelling under spice influence

- products
    - paper (use case?)
    - plastic
    - chemical explosives
    - spice cloth (use case?)
    - spice fiber

- deposits
    - worm size dependent deposits
    - remember waterfillage

- artificial spice from fish
- spice ionising/spraying for area effects -> addicting aliens, force attack

- getting alien blood samples
    - drop chance (low probability)
    - automatable
    - multiplicate samples (needs to be way more expensive)

# Bugs
- https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Mining_Drones mines wormholes, still the case?

# No plans yet
- spice needed for expensive researches
- Teleporting via Spice
- interstellar probes need spice
- beverages
    - coffee
    - beer
    - liquor

# Unlikely to be added in Future
- Warptorio support
- diverse SE support 
    - adding/modifying stuff isnt welcome by them
    - might change my opinion once that mindset of them changes
- spawn natural spice deposits only in desert (alien biomes) (eh idk, i just make it rare enough)
