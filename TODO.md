# Actual TODO
- vehicles
    - mobile spice harvester
        - not as expensive as water injector setup
        - less effective than water injector setup

- products
    - paper (use case?)
    - plastic
    - chemical explosives
    - spice cloth (use case?)
    - spice fiber

- thumper - calls worms
- artificial spice from fish
- (interstellar probes need spice)
- spawn worms when travelling under spice influence
- spice ionising/spraying for area effects -> addicting aliens, force attack
- worm size dependent deposits

# Possible Support
- Warptorio support

# No plans yet
- Teleporting via Spice
- beverages
    - coffee
    - beer
    - liquor

# Unlikely to be added in Future
- spawn natural spice deposits only in desert (alien biomes)
